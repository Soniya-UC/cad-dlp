Assignment 5: Exploring Data-Level Parallelism (DLP) in Modern Computing

code context :

Part 2: Exploring DLP Architectures : 2. Vector Architectures: vector_add.c is a simple vector processing task using a se.py as simulator in gem5.

Part 2: Exploring DLP Architectures : 3. SIMD Instruction Set Extensions: vector_add_scaler.c & vector_add_avx.c are the 2 programs used for comparitive analysis based upon performance & its implementation techniques.

Part 4: Loop-Level Parallelism and DLP in Software : enhance_llp.cpp is the program demonstrating the techniques for detecting Loop-Level Parallelism.

********** all the binaries generated as part of the above 3 implementations are also committed.**************
